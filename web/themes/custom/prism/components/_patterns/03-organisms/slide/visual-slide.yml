intro_text:
  '<p>Replica is ILR’s primary typeface. It is featured in the wordmark and should be used in all visual assets, both printed and on screen.</p>
   <p>Replica is a contemporary sans serif designed by Dimitri Bruni and Manuel Krebs. The design is inspired by the classic sans-serif grotesques widely used in the 1950s, the formative years of ILR’s history.</p>
   <p>It’s built around a strict grid that gives it a geometric feel and a unique shape to its terminals. These beveled forms are the starting point for the open frame—the primary graphic element of ILR’s graphic identity (see below).</p>'
